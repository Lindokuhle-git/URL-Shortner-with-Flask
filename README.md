# URL-Shortner-with-Flask
generates a shortened URL that redirects to the original link. 
Flask can handle URL routing and database operations to store and retrieve the mappings between the short and original URLs.
The project also makes use of data manipulation (also known as CRUD) using sql, allowing the user to read and delete the urls they have submitted to be shortened.

If you can't seem to find SQLITE3 on your pc or is not available with the python verson you are using, you can research more about how to install it according to the operating system you are using.
